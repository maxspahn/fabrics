# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [unreleased]

### Bug Fixes

- Fixes distance line to line clamping error.
- Fixes panda example for capsule cuboid geometry and adds corresponding tests. Still an issue with some capsules due to Jdot being nan.

### Miscellaneous Tasks

- Adds depration to required dependencies.

### WIP

- Panda dual arm.

### Ft[coverage]

- Adds test for generic leaf and capsule cuboid leaf.

### Ft[cuboids]

- Uncomments cuboid capsule related maps.

### Ft[example]

- Restores simple panda example and adds simple dual vacuum example.

### Ft[helpers]

- Adds helper function to compute rotation matrix.

### Ft[rotation]

- Deprecates angle usage in subgoals.
- Changes panda examples to not use subgoal attribute angle anymore.

### Ft[rotations]

- Idea on simplifying rotations is working :rocket.

## [0.8.7] - 2023-09-29

### Bug Fixes

- Fixes line to line and cuboid distances.

### Ft[cpp-bridge]

- Adds some basic documentation.
- Adds commented line in panda example to export as c code.

### Ft[cpp]

- Allows to export planner as c code. Adds example of how to use it.

### Ft[distance]

- Changes line-to-line distance to a closed form solution rather than sampling.

### Ft[distances]

- Adds sample-free distance computation for cuboids.
